          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>Based on the scatter plot, one can infer that as the poverty level increases, the number of individuals without
            healthcare generally increases. There are some outliers in the dataset but by observing the plot, there seems to 
          be a positive correlation between the poverty percentage and the lacks healthcare percentage.</p>

          <p>It would seem based on the data, that Texas is the major outlier in the dataset.  Although there are several
            states with a higher percentage of poverty, Texas is the leading state in terms of citizens lacking healthcare on
            a percentage basis.  There seems to be other forces at play but more research is needed to determine the cause.
